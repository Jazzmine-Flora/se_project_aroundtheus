**Things that i've learned**

In this project i have learned how elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
I also learned grid functions and its properties and how flexbox and grid can be applied together where needed.
However, i would still like to improve my understanding in how to use these and media screen properties.

I am excited to use everything i learned in real life projects.
Even though its hard to understand sometimes and frustrating, I still find it interesting at the end of the projects how things comes out.

I might have few Errors but i am willing to correct them after review.
